# Easter egg list in ReactJS

Taken from: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a8319f257c562ede8000037/train/javascript

Changes and comments from me:
* Implement in Typescript
* Use functional react
* Testing with current testing-library for reactase

---

Write a react component that will display the current value of our counter.

* The counter should start at 0.
* There should be a button to add 1.
* There should also be a button to subtract 1.

We want to be able to see the value of the counter - so it should be rendered! And for your buttons to work they will need an onClick prop.

In your render you should return:

* The counter display element with an id of 'counter', containing the counter value.
* An increment button with an id of 'increment'
* A decrement button with an id of 'decrement'
