## State Management Complexity

> Summary: Create a user interface for tictactoe that also enables the user to
> go back and forward to a previous board state of a game. Make sure that you
> reduce state management complexity by deriving most states instead of storing
> them.

* Write a user interface for Tic Tac Toe
* Be able to pause a game, close the tab, and then resume the game later
* Include a restart button (disabled before starting the game)
* Display the status of the game (winner, whose turn is it, if the game is finished etc)
* Be able to keep a history of the game; allow players to go backward and forward in time
